📚 CP400S Course Project — Class Management and SQL Security Demonstrator

Welcome to the Class Management and SQL Security Demonstrator — a full-featured web application designed to simulate a classroom environment for both teachers and students, while also demonstrating the difference between secure and insecure login practices, including SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

✨ Features

👨‍🏫 For Teachers
- View and manage student accounts 👩‍🎓
- Add, edit, and remove assignments ✍️
- Input and modify student grades 📊
- View detailed assignment statistics:
  - Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max, Variance, Std Deviation
- Update teacher login credentials 🔐

👩‍🎓 For Students
- Secure or insecure login options 🔓🔒
- View only their personal grades per assignment 📈
- Update their own password 💬

⚠️ Demonstration of SQL Injection

This system comes with two login modes:
- 🔐 Secure Login: Uses prepared statements and input sanitization (prevents SQL Injection).
- 🔓 Insecure Login: Uses raw SQL string concatenation — intentionally vulnerable to demonstrate how SQL Injection attacks work.

Try entering:
    ' OR '1'='1
…as a username or password in the insecure login to see how it bypasses authentication.

🔧 Technologies Used
- PHP (Procedural)
- MySQL
- HTML & CSS (Basic Styling)
- Password hashing with password_hash() and password_verify()

🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the project folder into your web server directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP or /var/www/html).
2. Import the MySQL database using the provided schema.
3. Configure db_secure.php and db_insecure.php with your database credentials.
4. Start your server and navigate to index.php.
